## Brewing Notes  
A special edition of our Red Clay APA brewed with peppercorns. 'PIPA' = Peppercorn IPA.  
Original gravity = 1.062  
Final gravity = 1.020

## Tasting Notes
The pepper flavor was weaker than we'd hoped, but the Citra hops were spot on. Good enough to win "People's Choice" in the 2015 BAMO homebrew contest!
